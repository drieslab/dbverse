**Note: work in progress**

The `dbverse` is an ecosystem of open-source and composable database libraries for larger-than-memory scientific data analysis. The `dbverse` provides object relational mappings for common scientific data objects, including sparse and dense matrices, spatial geometries, and others, and is powered by DuckDB.

The goal of `dbverse` is to enable larger-than-memory scientific data analysis across programming languages with databases. Please visit the packages page for details about each `dbverse` package. On release, the `dbverse` is compatible with R with support for other languages planned in the future.
