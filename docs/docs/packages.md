# Core packages
`dbverse` currently consists of four core libraries that contain classes, generics, and methods for representing and analyzing scientific data objects in a `DuckDB` database.

1.  [`{dbMatrix}`](https://drieslab.github.io/dbMatrix) - A library for sparse/dense matrix operations in a database.
2.  [`{dbSpatial}`](https://drieslab.github.io/dbSpatial) - A library for spatial operations in a database.
3.  `{dbData}` - A library with specifications for base class of `dbverse`. **In progress**.
4.  `{dbSequence}` - A library for genomic sequence operations in a database. **In progress**.
